Predicting Best Crop for the Particular Places


Problem Statement

Farmer are backbone of our country and they are valuable asset of our society .
Presently many farmers are committing suicide unable to pay the debt and farmers 
are not getting the right price for their crops .  The plans implemented by the 
government in the farming sector didn’t reach out to the farmers  .Many plans 
failed due to corruption(Udyoga Khatri Yojana , crop insurance plans).
Farming in our country is not well structured . our project can help the 
farmers and Government to build and Maintain well structured Farming System.


Solution

Motto of our project :- One Town one crop system.

This problem can be solved by Taking all farmers data into account  . this data helps
Researchers to decide and allocate particular crop to the suitable Area . 
This system doesn’t force farmers to cultivate suggested crop in Whole Field because 
the farmer needs some crops for their daily use. 
So the formers  can use 50% of their land to cultivate on government suggested crop and 
another 50% of land can be used for cultivating crops for their daily use.
Due to fluctuation in the crop production the price of the crops increases and decreases . 

Rate of Production inversely   proportional to the price . 
This system helps establishes stabilized production of crops . large price variation in the crops can be reduced .
